The *vehicle routing problem* (VRP) is a combinatorial optimization and integer programming problem which asks "What is the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of customers?". ... The objective of the VRP is to minimize the total route cost.

*Route Optimization* is a solution for two of the most difficult computer science problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). Health delivery system face these problems every day, when they are planning routes for a fleet of vehicles that must deliver to multiple health facilities destinations.
